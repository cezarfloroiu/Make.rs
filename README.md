# Make.rs

This is a place where makers show the world what they've made.  
It's a different kind of profile page where it's not about the companies you worked for but what you've done.  
It's also a place where you discover other makers like you. Get feedback or let others know what you think about their work.  
It's where you get inspired and motivated.  
It's where you learn and grow.
